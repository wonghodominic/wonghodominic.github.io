    <p>Hello this is Dominic Wong. I am a UC Berkeley senior majoring in Economics and minoring in Computer Sceience. I started coding in Fall 2017. Before that, I have never thought of learing computer or coding related things as I have never been  exposed to this kind of knowledge. However, I took my first CS class in my life, CS61A (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs aka Python, SQL and Scheme?!) in Berkeley becuase of my friends' recommendation. I felt so hard to pick up at first due to the huge difference of conceptual thinking. However, I found out CS could be really interesting because you keep solving problems and making new stuff. I further self-learn web development by myself after chatting with my another friend. I have been really into web developing because I can actually make my own website and design it in any way I want. Hope that your enjoy my webpages:)</p>
